This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and you attempt to render an item that contains a component that does not correctly handle the `undefined` value.  This is a common issue when your data source has missing or undefined properties that the component tries to access. For example, if your data looks like this:

```javascript
data = [{
  name: 'Item 1',
  description: 'Description 1'
}, {
  name: 'Item 2'
}];
```

and your FlatList item renderer tries to access `item.description` in all cases, the second item will throw an error because `description` is undefined.
