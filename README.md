# React Native FlatList undefined is not an object error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's FlatList component and provides a solution.

The error, `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'item.description')`, occurs when rendering a FlatList item that attempts to access a property which is undefined in the underlying data source.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the error in the console.

**Solution:** The solution involves implementing proper null or undefined checks within the item renderer to handle cases where the expected properties are missing.
